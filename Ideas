== These are grammars I would like to see:

- pcre.pgx - PCRE Regular Expressions
- tt2.pgx - Template Toolkit II
- perl6.pgx - Perl 6
- coffee.pgx - CoffeeScript
- yaml.pgx - YAML
- kwim.pgx - Kwim Markup
- socialtext.pgx - Socialtext Markup

== Refactor Changes (2.0)
- Ship Pegex.pm with dzil.
  - Can put TestML::Compiler::Lite into inc/
- Remove <> rule braces
- Support '…' literal text
  - 'foo.bar baz' → /foo\.bar\ baz/
  - / 'foo' . 'bar.' / → /foo.bar\./
- A Grammar is really just an OO class
- A pgx grammar file defines rules for the class
- Rules are like methods
- Rules can be actual methods too
- Regexes or refs-to-regexes should be combined into a single regex
- Support grammar names, inheritance, inclusion
- Support symrules
- Make Pegex::Grammar::Atoms a real class the is the default parent class
- '-' always means '_' in a rulename
- Atoms support:
  %symrule + __
  %symrule ~ _
  %symrule ~~ __
  _: /WS*/
  __: /WS+/
- Support rule namespacing: grammar-name:rule-name
- Rules now must start: "(\n|;\ *)rule-name: "
- %include error-class
  - Names a pegex class containing error rules
  - grammar name is 'error'
  - foo: bar | baz | !! # same as:
    - foo: bar | baz | error:foo
